if u check if node1 = node2 in linked list then not only its [val, next] pointer is checked it checks if its at the same memory block. so 

so even 2 nodes have same value and next pointer value is same like 4->3->4->3 and 2->3->5, both 4 nodes are different

https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/description/




when ur distance is not equl to each negihout i,e using heap for bfs than u cant have vis, since node may have shorter dis in next few steps so u use dis[] instead of vis[] for bfs heap cases

IN toposort u can use normal logic to color each traversal using one unique color  instead of 1 and 2

        adj = [[] for i in range(n)]
        vis = [0 for i in range(n)]    
        for placing on 4th position
        
ans =sorted(ans) or ans.sort() same wiht reversed and .reverse()  
        in python while loop check while condition every iteration and for loops sets value once 
 so in level order traversal while(q): for i in range(len(q)):
        

s=s[:4]+'e'+s[5:]


                        temp = str(temp)
In python to convert anything to anything just write in starting a = list(a) a = string(b) a = set(a)


ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡Whether u have set/dict of int or strings like in word ladder or set of lists insertion, searching tc is o(1). 

ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡MY whole thinking was wrong. set/dict uses hashtable for all not like if set of string it will have  tc = tc of set searching * word lengthğŸ˜¤

PYTHON use HASHTABLE ave tc of set/map insertion/deletion/searching is o(1) only
MASTER
EXCEPT INT ALL VISITED MARKING USING MAP/set
EVEN IF LIST OF LIST OF INT use set 
When you are delling with string like graph of words, u cant implement some crazy algo , for marking visited dont use vis[i] use set to store words and check dont thing about tc.

Only 2 things like list of int a and for matrix u can a same size list and matrix for marking vis . OTHER than that use set even if list of list of int like circle point [[0,1], [4,4]) use set.
Dont think about tc its same only. 

IN above case list because commonly used.


 For string/words problems use set for marking visited and dict for any computation like parent[word[i]] =  word[c](in word ladder 2)  u cant use list in string

 
 Basically u can mark visited using map but set looks cool but NEVER EVER TRY TO USE LIST

I am bad when even a single loop brackets comes and i just want to quitğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡ğŸ˜¡
while writing also it takes times because autocomplete not worksğŸ˜¤ğŸ˜¤ğŸ˜¤ in looping and its so confusingğŸ˜¤ğŸ˜¤
FOUND SPEED GOES SIGNIFICANTLY DOWN AND LOGICAL THINKING IN LOOP OF [[]] SO TRY TO AVOID 


THERE ARE MANY FLAGS U CAN PUT, REMOVE A SINGLE SOLUTION


so x= c[0] and grid[x][y] instead of grid[c[0]][c[1]]

NO PAIRS in python simple language
Certainly! Here's the equivalent code in Python for the given operations on different data types:

ğŸ¥³BFS without levelorder traversal or priority could be done by dfs also. Only question that req priorityqueue or level order traversal could be done by BFS.
ğŸ¥³pop for rightmost element in list(stack), queue. popleft() for leftmost in deque


ğŸ¥³del a[i] for any element in list, dict(map).  .add(element).remove(element) for set

ğŸ¥³ceil() and floor()

ğŸ¥³dafaultdict(defaultdict(int)) for adjacenylist  g[a][b] = val  

ğŸ¥³Iteration
```
for key in my_dict:
    print(key, my_dict[key])
for element in set:
    print(element)
```

in for all things just like MySQL for searching

1. Dynamic Arrays (List):
   
```python
LEEetcode python is 3.11 so by default defaultdict is ordered only
a = []
a.append(element)
last = a.pop()  //here pop returns value and pops the last elemetn   a.remove(element)    del a[index]
size = len(a)
last = a[i]
del a[i]
For appending shallow copy of list into another list
ans.append(temp.copy())
```

2. String(immutable):
```python
s = "Hello, World!"
temp = str_var
temp += 'c'   # this creates a new string with same name temp, the previous with 
size = len(str_var)
c = str_var[i]
my_string = my_string[:-1]    # Slice to exclude last character, this make new string, since string are immutable in python

For appending shallow copy of string into another list
ans.append(s)    # since string are immutable so this string is not going to be modified in future. Even if add or slice this a new string is generated with same name
```

3. Char:
```python
c = 'A'
```

5. Stack:
Python doesn't have a built-in implementation of a traditional stack. Lists in Python can be used as stacks

6. Queue(deque):

```python
Python's `deque` can be used as a double-ended queue, Python has queue but its more for complicated task not used for DSA
from collections import deque

q = deque()
q.append(element)
q.popleft()
size = len(q)
front = q[0]

deque_var = deque()
deque_var.appendleft(element)
deque_var.append(element)
deque_var.popleft()
deque_var.pop()
first = deque_var[0]
last = deque_var[-1]
size = len(deque_var)
```

8. Priority Queue (using heapq):
```python
import heapq

# Example of Min-Heap
h = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
heapq.heapify(h)
print("Min-Heap:", h)

# Example of Max-Heap (by negating values)
h = [-x for x in min_heap]
heapq.heapify(h)
print("Max-Heap:", [-x for x in h])

# Inserting into Min-Heap
heapq.heappush(h, 0)
print("After inserting 0 into Min-Heap:", h)

# Inserting into Max-Heap (by negating value)
heapq.heappush(h, -7)
print("After inserting -7 into Max-Heap:", [-x for x in h])

# Popping from Min-Heap
min_value = heapq.heappop(h)
print(f"Popped from Min-Heap: {min_value}, Updated Min-Heap: {h}")

# Popping from Max-Heap (by negating value)
max_value = -heapq.heappop(h)
print(f"Popped from Max-Heap: {max_value}, Updated Max-Heap: {[-x for x in h]}")

```

9. Map (Dictionary):
```python
m = defaultdict(int) #Unordered (value datatype inside small bracket)
#In python u give the parent datastruture i,e if u want in verticalorder traversal map of list of int , u give defaultdict(list)
m = {}  # m = defaultdict(int) is orderedmap used in vertical order traversal of tree
m[key] = value
del m[key]
size = len(m)
if key in m:
    value = m[key]
```

10. Set:
```python
s = set()
For converiont of list to set : s= set(listName)
s.add("Element1")
s.remove("Element2")
size = len(s)
iterator = iter(s)
if next(iterator, None) is not None:
    first_element = next(iterator)
if target_element in s:
    # Do something



5. Stack:
Python doesn't have a built-in implementation of a traditional stack. Lists in Python can be used as stacks
```

```

8. Priority Queue (using heapq):
```python
import heapq

# Example of Min-Heap
min_heap = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
heapq.heapify(min_heap)
print("Min-Heap:", min_heap)

# Example of Max-Heap (by negating values)
max_heap = [-x for x in min_heap]
heapq.heapify(max_heap)
print("Max-Heap:", [-x for x in max_heap])

# Inserting into Min-Heap
heapq.heappush(min_heap, 0)

# Inserting into Max-Heap (by negating value)
heapq.heappush(max_heap, -7)

# Popping from Min-Heap
min_value = heapq.heappop(min_heap)

# Popping from Max-Heap (by negating value)
max_value = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)

```

9. Map (Dictionary):
```python

m = defaultdict(int) #defauldict is part of normal dict i,e m={} which was made to solve keyerror problem. So both are ORDERED if u are using python 3.7 or above else unordered
m[key] = value
m.pop(key)
size = len(m)
if key in m:
    value = m[key]


m = OrderedDict() # u need to handle keyerror i,e if(key not in m) m[key]=0 else: m+=1
```

10. Set:
```python
s = set()
s= set(listName)
s.add("Element1")
s.remove("Element2")
size = len(s)
iterator = iter(s)
if next(iterator, None) is not None:
    first_element = next(iterator)
if target_element in s:
    # Do something
```

Note: Python dictionaries can be used as maps.




describe how to declare, add , remove and determine size in  java  of following datatypes array , dynamic array , string , char , stack , queue, deque, priority queue, map

```
ğŸŸ¢ğŸ˜Š c++ over python because, u need to explain what is array in commment instead directly write in cpp as vector
      Similar to java , i,e spring boot
      No multiple library , only bits 
      No priority queue hard. 
      Majority leetcode in cpp
      mcq of coding round
      public,protected, private already written 
      
ğŸŸ¢ğŸ˜ŠğŸ˜’ğŸ˜’ Always always analyze the time complexity.
If its 10^4 or 10^5, there is high chance it uses map or set nlogn

ğŸŸ¢max/min between any number of arguments :  int a= max({a,b,c});

ğŸŸ¢Learn the techniques of all question which method will be used so that even implementation fails,u get points

ğŸŸ¢For online round :

To convert int to long long : long long new= (long long)old;  & vice versa i,e int new = (int)old;

int to string : to_string(num);

string to int : stoi(str);

char to int & int to char : -'0' - 'a' respectively

Size of string is not in int when applying max,min function

(int)forbidden[i].size()

ğŸŸ¢Only normal queue & deque has front back
  
lexographically maximum no subset more than 10 questions with different just remember it is solved by stack

ğŸ‘‰ for(auto &i:mapp) Use &i otherwise iterator will remain on 1st element

ğŸ‘‰ ROWs == RECORDs while column means attributes

ğŸ‘‰In Matrix's 4 way travelling if(vis[i][j]) return; is not tle for dfs(i-1,j) & dfs(i,j-1);

BUT once rejected/deleted element for current is then rejected for all other element
IN NGR  element which is not next greater than current cant be next greater for the rest behind it

ğŸ‘‰Thumb rule : Always intialize the queue,stack,map etc before the doing any operation on it in loops.

ğŸ‘‰Iterators:

for(auto i:m) i.first i.second

for(auto i=m.begin(); i!=m.end(); i++) m

ğŸ‘‰ If 2 or more arrays or numbers in questions for comparision like A & B.

Always make 1 smaller if(A>B) swap(A,B) & then solve accordingly.

ğŸ‘‰ Never do modulo as %10^7+7 [Error]. Instead do %1000007

ğŸ‘‰lower_bound(v.begin(),v.end(),val) gives index of 1st occurence of val if present
