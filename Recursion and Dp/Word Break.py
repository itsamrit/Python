# ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©U need to cross match all words of dictionary to all words formed from string 
# // More similar problems to word break : Extra Characters in a String
# // Method 2 : You just need to match all words with all dictionary.  So instead of searching each string in dictionary , you can do vice versa.
# //     ğŸŸ©In dp there is no optimization that u start from smallest or largest word. Start from anywhere, u need to cross match all words of dictionary to all words formed from string and find min or max or whatever is asked.
